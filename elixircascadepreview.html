<h1>THE ELIXIR CASCADE<h1>
<h1><b>PREVIEW</b></h1>

<h1>Prologue</h1>
<p>
A glimpse – or not even that – just a sliver of early-morning light blinked through the slightly open, white coloured shutters. Alison winced, put her hands in front of her face to stop the sharp, bright light blinding her and pushed herself up so she could swing her legs off her bed’s  mattress. She padded along the blue bedroom’s fake wool carpet to the window, reached upwards, and dragged the white string downwards so hard that the shutters accelerated upwards so fast that it  sounded like a set of sails of a galley being drawn up in a gale. The view was spectacular; white sand stretched as far as the horizon, from which the bright yellow sun was rising into the rich cloudless, turquoise-coloured sky, shining down on the desert in front of it. She smiled, turned around, put a long white t-shirt on and went to get breakfast.
</p>


<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<p> Sam pushed his chair backwards quickly and viciously away from his fake marble-textured, white painted wooden desk. Even though its legs were finished with black, smooth rubber wheels, this still caused a howling screech as the oak-designed floor of the office tried to resist, unsuccessfully, being refashioned with deep, undesirable tread marks. The sound bounced on and off the bleached white walls of the cavernous, crowded, but otherwise deadly quiet office that he was sitting in. 
</p>
<P>
This sat on the top of a towering grey concrete built skyscraper that was placed in the middle of the city, looming over the thousands of individuals and vehicles that buzzed around its foundations, working tirelessly to support the infinite and merciless needs of the wires that kept Sam and his colleagues’ society up right. 
</P>
<p>
He glared at the numbers in the Excel window that sank in the white HD screen in front of him. A screen that was enclosed by the thin, pitch-black plastic rectangle that was ubiquitous to all the other hundreds of computer screens that were ranked up in tight rows across the room. Something was wrong, he knew it – someone had messed up.
</P>
<P>
After he had counted up everything again and so he calculated the progression of the profits it was obvious that there was less than there should be. He entered the numbers into several types of statistic and financial software programs that were available to him and he  had his suspicions confirmed. And so he dragged the files onto his personal email and flew them off to his manager whom he hoped would have a better about this idea than he did.
</P>
<p>
In less than ten minutes he felt his phone, surprisingly not his office one, chirping that f at him from his black cotton jacket that sat behind him over the back of his chair. He picked it up.
</p>
<p>
“Yes?” he asked with that sharp, arrogant and slightly disingenuous tone that he had unintentionally picked in the few months he had been working in the city .
</p>
<p>
“Mr Patel can you please come to my office?”  It was, not surprisingly to Sam, his boss.
</p>
<p>
 “I’ll be there in a second.” 
 </p>
 <p>
After striding quickly across the same wooden floor that appeared in every office of the building Sam reached the red painted door of his boss’s office. It had the name, Alex Golding stenciled in fake gold italic letters at the top of the door frame. He knocked gently on the door. 
</p>
<P>
“Come in!” 
</P>
<p>
Sam twisted the steel handle down and pushed the door open easily and walked in.
</p>
<p>
“Ah Mr Patel, thank you for coming,” said the sharp-faced figure that Sam knew was Alex, despite never having talked to him before. He was probably somewhere at least in his early fifties but had the physique of someone in their late thirties who frequently visited the gym.
</p>
<p>
“My pleasure.” Sam replied bit to quickly for his own pleasure.
</p>
<p>
“Sorry we don’t really have time for the normal pleasantries,” Alex commented with an asymmetrical twitch on the right side of his lips and a quick glance at his screen. He then, while still staring at his white rimmed mac screen, he said, “It would seem you have discovered something that might interest me – could you please show it to me again?”
</p>>
<p>
“Of course.”
</p>
<p>
Sam grabbed one of the wooden, wheelie chairs that were stacked up in the corner of the office, rolled it over to the desk and sat down beside Alex. He quickly located and defined the figures that he had discovered, dragged them onto a new file and created hypothetical measurements of the profits – or more importantly, the losses of the company’s investments into several international pharmaceutical research companies that sold patents
to other much larger pharmaceutical companies.	
</p>
<p>
“Right,” said Alex interrupting Sam from his flickering across the screen, “I see, that should be quite easy to fix now we know, thank god you saw this before it became irreversible Sam, I can see you’re going to go far with us.”
</p>
<p>
Sam grinned, “No, thank you, I’m glad I could help.”
</p>
<br/>
<p> - <p>
<br/>
<p>
Sam left Alex’s room with a bit of a swagger. He had been there just over a month and he had already contributed to the fundamentals. More importantly the big man of the department had noticed him – things are going well, he thought.
</p>
<p>
He continued the rest of the day pretty light heartedly and all the data recording, which he normally found suicide-provokingly dull went like nothing. It got to five o’clock and all his colleagues were starting to leave. He shut down his laptop and filed the papers which he had been analyzing that afternoon; Alex still insisted there had to be hard copies of all the data that has been analyzed in his department, even though Sam thought it probably took a huge chunk of the department’s profits. Nevertheless he knew himself that digital data can be corrupted quite easily if you know how to. Nothing else out of the unordinary had sprung out on him that day so he stood up, put his jacket back on and wandered off to the elevators on his floor.
</p>
<p>
Due to the fact that he worked so high up in building it was going to take him quite some time for him to reach the ground floor at the bottom of the 77-floor tower. It was also the rush hour, so the elevator stopped at nearly every floor allowing another inward flow of temporary components of the building.
</p>
<p>
After thirty floors down Sam found himself shoved against the back corners of the elevator. To his side there was a forty-something large balding man who looked like he had let his physical appearance go fantastically from when he was younger. He could feel the heavily built, sweaty frame pushing him backwards into the form of a light pretty woman who was about his age and looked like she still found the elevator rush hour a bit of a novelty. He quickly apologized to her.
</p>
<p>
“I’m so sorry, there’s this guy on my other side who’s taking a bit more space than he should.”
</p>
<p>
She looked at him with her sparkling green eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Ha…that’s fine, don’t worry. This is my first week here so I have to adjust to a new environment really,” she replied with a big grin with its pristine, china white symmetrical teeth flashing at him.
</p>
<p>
He smiled back. “It’s gonna take us along time to get to the bottom floor –what’s your name?”
</p>
<p>
“Anouska, or my friends call me Nousk. I work for the health insurance department on the 50th floor. It’s a bit depressing really. What do you do?” she asked with a shy glance.
</p>
<p>
“I’m Sam, I work for the finance analyst department based on the 75th floor.”
</p>
<p>
They continued their social banter until the machine stopped at another floor and there was a jolt. This time a larger influx of people than normal entered the elevator and the bigger man was budged backwards separating Sam and Anouska. They both found themselves in different groups of identically suited businessmen on other sides of the lift.
</p>
<p>
Sam tried to get up on his tip toes to see where she was, but even though he was a tall guy, Anouska, due of her tiny frame, was completely hidden by the crowd of tailored suits. Feeling disappointed, he sat back on his heels and thought maybe he could catch her when they got to the ground floor.
</p>
<p>
For the next twenty minutes he stood there listening to the office banter of mostly middle age men. This was mainly about their wives, houses, mortgages and children, and at every floor the tiny free surface area of the elevator became tighter and tighter and he was pushed further and further back into the corner. He could feel his heart rate spiking, his breathing becoming faster and deeper as the population of the lift increased dramatically every time they stopped.
</p>
<p>
Eventually he felt the elevator resting to its final position and its steel, curved double doors sprang open into the whitewashed lobby of the bank. With great relief Sam could feel his shoulders relaxing, his breathing slowing and his heart rate returning to its normal one hundred eighteen and seventy-eight rate. He was nearly the last person that was spat out of the cube shaped machine so he started to peer around trying to see Anouska in the crowd of business men and women rushing home like a swarm of black beetles fighting over each other to reach their prey. There must have been hundreds of them he guessed as he followed, or was really more pushed, into the outside of the building and quickly he found himself in the limestone paved courtyard outside with its preened flower pots and emerald green coloured bushes dotted around it. These were supposed to reduce the city’s frantic ambience that appeared just twenty yards away over the high grey concrete walls that enclosed the square.
</p>
<p>
 He looked around then he noticed Nousk sitting quietly on a dark, wooden bench on the other side of the courtyard,adjacently to a bright bush with yellow dandelions shooting from its roots. He started walking to her, but when he was not even halfway there he saw a broad shouldered, slightly shorter man approaching her. He noticed her looking at him from the phone that she had been texting on and when this man got closer she stood up, took a couple of steps towards him and gave him a kiss on each cheek and a hug.
 </p>
 <p>
Sam shrugged. “Well maybe not this time, I have had a constructive day at work. You can’t have everything.”
</p>
<p>
  He left the courtyard for the busy, loud, frantic noise of road outside and put himself onto a bus to get home. 
 </p>
 <p>
	
He got off at the high street and started walking back to his flat on the first floor of a terraced, white Edwardian house that sat a bit back from the pavement of a wide thoroughfare. He could hear the sound of the traffic roaring along it even in the earliest hours in the morning when he was in bed. Indeed, even though he hadn’t been there that long, he now thought that he might have problems sleeping without that nearly continuous, wiring noise buzzing through his window.  He blundered along smiling at the very well-groomed oak trees that ran all along his road; it was beautiful as the sunset shone through their autumnal, orange-tinted leaves that now looked relatively sparse in the branches compared to what they had been like that morning and he could feel the fallen under his feet. This felt as if they had all massed together and cemented onto the pavement as some sort of organic, artificial, wool like material. This organic but novel compound cushioned every step he took very nicely.
</p>
<p>
He rented a small studio. With his already decent salary he could have afforded a better and bigger place, but he didn’t want to look like a snob and anyway if it was smaller then there was less space he had to clean.
</p>
<p>
On his way home he saw an old man sitting against a brick wall, clothed with a large black rain coat, which was good because Sam could feel that it had started to rain, with a splatter of the drops flickering onto his face. The old man also had a small damp, dark grey mongrel lying beside him with drops from the rain running off the tip of it nose.
</p>
<p>
He crouched down, slightly unconsciously, in 
front of the man and offered him the packet of salt and vinegar crisps that he had put in his left side jacket pocket before he had got onto the bus, but had completely forgotten about due to his thoughts of Anouska.
</p>
<p> 
“Thank you,” said the old man, who took it, opened the packet and quickly started consuming its contents, with old smiling wrinkles appearing upon his cheeks.
</p>
<p>
Sam patted the head of the dog gently, smiled back at the man, stood up and walked back home. 
</p>
<p>	
After he had eventually shoved the front door of the house inwards, still stiff due to the recent restoration of the building, and had climbed up the new pristine steel staircase onto the first floor, he unlocked his flat’s navy blue coloured door and threw his tailored black jacket onto his navy two-seated sofa.
</p>
<p>
He slept well that night until his mobile waked him , with that now common, annoying “good morning, it’s before eight” bleeping rhythm that he  always regretted choosing the next morning. The sun hadn’t even arisen yet, and except for the luminance outside that reached through the window from the street lights and the front lights of the few speeding cars that drove through the road at this time in morning, Sam could only really see pitch darkness. He grabbed at his lamp’s switch, pressed it and he could now see where the mobile had fallen down from his bedside table with its power cabled still plugged in. He picked it up and brought to his right ear.
</p>
<p>
“Sam! Sorry to call you at this time, but we kind of need you to come to the office ASAP.” It was Alex, and he sounded a bit worried.
</p>
<p>
He frowned but replied politely “Sure no problem, although can I at least ask why you need me at this ungodly hour of the morning?” 
</p>
<p>
“I’ve been talking to the CEO of the company in the States about the data that you discovered and we have decided that, as you were the one who discovered this, you might give us a better idea of the possibilities and situations we might find ourselves in."
</p>
<p>
 “I’ll be there as soon as possible.” 
</p>
<p>
“Very good, see you soon.”
</p>
<p>
He shoved on the same clothes that he had worn the day before from a pile of unwashed clothes that he had left on the floor just beside his bed. He cleared his throat and woke himself up quickly with a glass of water from the sink, ran out of the house and managed to catch a night bus. He got to the city center in twenty minutes from when he had put the phone down.
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>
“Thank you for coming at such short notice,” said Alex taking the phone away from his ear and gesturing towards Sam after he had appeared at his door.
</p>
<p>
He still didn’t really know exactly what he could contribute to this, but Alex said quite purposefully, “Sam just broadly explain what you saw, I’ve already described the problem to him and the possible scenarios. I could try to explain it to him, but he wants to hear it from the horse’s mouth as the old saying goes. “
</p>
<p>
Sam took the phone and after the normal niceties of a conversation between a boss and his employee, Sam slowly explained the figures and the time lines that he saw the day before.
</p>
<p>
After five minutes of Sam’s babbling in numeric and algebraic phenomena, the American on the other end of the line eventually interrupted him and replied that he was very grateful and was now satisfied with what Sam had told him and asked him to return the phone back to Alex.
</p>
<p>
Alex, who had been leaning back into his black office chair while looking at Sam intently as he had been on the phone , took it back with a smile and apologized again about the early morning call and then suggested, or more ordered Sam to go home and have the rest of the day off. 
</p>
<p>
He left the skyscrapers’ courtyard entrance and walked into the high street that was already starting to get busy, as it was the start of the rush hour. He suddenly became aware of the lack of sleep he had had and could barely keep himself awake on the way back home as he sat on the top floor of the bus, wishing that the glass was made of softer material as he kept banging the left side of his head into it every time the vehicle jolted or shuddered to stop.
</p>
<p>
Eventually he got to the stop that was closest to home and got off through the double glass doors of the bus after they had opened with a hiss and screech.
</p>
<p>
He stood at the edge of the curb of the long road near home, he had been living there long enough to know that the next pedestrian crossings were more than ten minutes away and it would be easier and quicker if he quickly crossed the road where he was. He looked both ways and the road very wasn’t busy. It was also only six o’clock in the morning and the traffic tended not to appear until at least seven am, so he started to cross the road wishing for his bed. He got two thirds of the way across the road when he suddenly heard the sound of a vehicle’s brake pressing down hard with a deafening screech. Then everything went black.
