<h1>Telomerfurase (Book II of the Elixir Series)<h1>
<p><b>PREVIEW</b></p>

<h1>Prologue</h1>


	

<p>
	Thiago open his eyes, damn that hurt he thought! He put his hand onto his chest where the hit him and there wa fortunately for him, his paranoia had saved him, it had eventually happened, wearing the vest all that time with the fake blood had saved him and all that meditation had allowed him to  keep his heart rate so slow it made it look like dead unless being properly analysed by a medically trained profession. Now he had to go before anyone could come back. He was now to the world he is dead. Since he had been here had already created many backups and pseudonyms  just because, but now more importantly now he has seen that his creation works perfectly. He still had that data from his work with Sam’s genome and he was certain, even without the facilities he could replicated them for him self now.

<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<p>
On the side of rocky hill situated on a green rich covered island in the middle of large ocean in the middle nowhere there is a pretty, beautifully built lime stone cottage,. This stone cottage has the standard weeds sprouting out of it’s crevasses and ivy sprawling down it’s walls as an old stone cottage should have. Inside this cottage is a woman sitting on he rocket chair with a couple of small children on her knees and below her feet. Although this woman is old he still shuns beauty out her pores and it was clear when she was younger she must have been nothing but a stunner.</p>
	<p>“Tell us again granny.” asked little girl  on her knees with pleading eyes.</p>
	<p>“Hattie I’ve told you all before many times, don’t you want to hear another story?”</p>
	<p>“Pleeeeeeeaaasss!!!!!”cheered the two boys below her feet.
	“Ok, ok, but this is the last time!”</p>
	<p>The boys grinned and the little girl snugged up into her lap satisfied.</p>
	<p>“Many years ago, When I first met  your grand dad we were living in a big city in an even bigger country…</p>
	<p>One of the  boys  interrupted her. "What's a city?”</p>
	<p>The old woman sighed “ I’ve told you this before, I know you remember what a city Alex.”</p>
	<p>“Really , I don’t remember“ said the boy hs sarcastically as a little boy can.</p>
	<p>She sighed even deeper “A city is a place were allot of people live.”
	<p>“Like Oranohaven?” asked the other boy.</p>
	<p>She rolled her eyes “ Just like Oranohaven, but much, much bigger.”
	“So a city has like hundred of people “ asked the boy who was older than the other" </p>
